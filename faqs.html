                            <p>The EHC Plan provides more protection for your child because:<ul><li>it gives you a route to challenge the council if it fails to ensure the provision in the EHC Plan is put place and delivered.</li><li>If you are unhappy with what the council says about your child’s needs or the provision needed to meet those needs you can challenge the council’s decision in the SEND tribunal.</li><li>You get to choose the school you want your child to go to and the council has to name your choice of school in the EHC Plan unless they consider it’s not suitable for the child or it would be unreasonable use of resources or would have an adverse impact on the education of the child or those they will go to school with. You could even choose an independent school and the council would still have to consider your choice. The council can only refuse your choice of an independent school if to agree to it would be incompatible with the efficient education or training of others or the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure.</li></ul></p>
