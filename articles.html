                    <h1>Avoiding Exclusion - Early Intervention</h1>
                    <p>Early intervention is important because unless you take action, your child is at risk of permanent exclusion, unauthorised absenteeism, being a school refuser, falling into anti-social behaviour patterns and worst case scenario joining the criminal justice system.</p>

                    <p>If your child has been permanently excluded from school or is at high risk of exclusion, this could be an indicator that state funded education is not working for them. You might therefore want to consider alternatives to state funded education.</p>
